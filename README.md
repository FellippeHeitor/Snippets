# Snippets
Code that's not part of any other project but may eventually be reused.

* scoreboard.bas - Contains code used to fetch and update a scoreboard text file on a non-HTTPs, PHP-enabled server.
* bouncingBalls.bas - Pseudo physics engine with rubber balls that can be dropped with a mouse click and that interact with each other. A "boing" sound file is embedded in the code and is dumped to disk at startup.
